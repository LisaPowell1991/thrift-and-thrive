# Thrift and Thrive üåü

Welcome to the Thrift and Thrive repository. This is a thrift shop application built with a React frontend and an Express.js backend. MySQL is used for the database.

## Project Information üì¢
- **Project Name:** Thrift and Thrive
- **Introduction:** So, why did I dive headfirst into the world of online thrifting? Well, let's just say I am a self-proclaimed "thrifter" extraordinaire. Well, it's simple really. As a self-proclaimed "thrifter" extraordinaire, I know the thrill of scoring fantastic second-hand finds that won't leave you penniless. Who needs to sacrifice an arm and a leg for quality when you can find hidden gems at bargain prices?
You won't find any fancy carts or pesky payment points cluttering up your browsing experience. Nope, we keep it simple yet effective. Our platform serves as a meeting ground for buyers and sellers to connect directly, negotiate prices, and seal the deal.
